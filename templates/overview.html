      <p>We chose to use an AWS RDS Database (Postgres build) paired with AWS S3 Buckets for our data.</p> 
      <p>We created a Bucket in AWS to hold our raw data, and used Postgres to manipulate, merge, and 
          process the data. From Postgres, data was loaded into Jupyter Notebooks to run our Machine Learning code.</p>
      <p>
        In Postgres, we first standardized the data files to ensure data was formatted correctly (headers were the same, data types were the same, etc). From there, we
        merged the Gold Prices, Inflation Data, and US Dollar index by Month & Year to create a final data set we could feed into our Machine Learning code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We ran into small hiccups when processing the Year and Month data in Postgres, especially as some data was daily and others were by Year / Month, but we were able to
        use our knowledge of data groups to process the information.

        <p>We chose to use an AWS EC2 to host our website, to create a public IP that could be accessed from anywhere and by anyone.</p> 
        <p>We chose to host using Ubuntu / Flask within the EC2 instance as a way to display out information. </p>
        <p>
          We ran into issues when deploying the Flask app into EC2, especially around installing and managing the proper requirements for hosting on EC2. Working with
          the security groups, key pairings, and Ubuntu / linux commands were not something we spent a ton of time on in class, but through reserach and help from our
          instructor and TA's we were able to successfully host the EC2 intance to share our data.

        <p>After several courses of analysis, we decided to use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to analyze Gold Prices against Inflation and the US Dollar Index to try and predict Gold Prices through 2030</p> 
        <p>We also chose to review how the Random Forest Regressor presented data as well.</p>

        <p>Outside of Amazon AWS, Postgres, and Machine Learning networks, we also utilized several other skills / applications to generate our analysis.</p> 
        <p>They are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Python & Pandas were used to code the Machine Learning Neural Networks, as seen in the links above.</li>
          <li>Tableau was used to generate our final analysis (see Analysis tab)</li>
          <li>HTML / CSS / Bootstrap was used to code this website</li>
          <li>Matplotlib was used to generate graph views within the Collab notesbooks, prior to exporting into Tableau</li>
