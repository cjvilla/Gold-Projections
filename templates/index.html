    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class = "row">
    <p>In 2020, the average closing price of Gold on the US Stock market was $1,773.73. Compared to June of 1971, when Gold was averaging $248.53, that's an increase of 613%! But... why?</p>
    <p class = "footnote"><i>Throughout the project, all reference to Gold prices are based on 24k / per oz.</i></p>
  </div>
  <div class = "row">
    <p>Does the price of Gold see an impact from Inflation Rate fluxuation? The change in the US Dollar index? Is there impact from the exchange rate of other currencies? 
      In this project, our group set out to understand what (if any) correlation these factors had with each other. 
    </p>
  
    <p>The major factors we chose to use when analyzing correlation of historical (and future) Gold prices were Inflation Rates, and the US Dollar Index. For background, those can be defined as:</p>

    <p><u>US Dollar Index</u></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The US Dollar Index is used to measure the value of the dollar against a basket of six world currencies - Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Swedish Krona.</li>
      <li>The index was established shortly after the Bretton Woods Agreement dissolved in 1973 with a base of 100, and values since then are relative to this base.</li>
      <li>The value of the index is fair indication of the dollarâ€™s value in global markets.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><u>Historical Inflation Rates</u></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The inflation rate is the percentage increase or decrease in prices during a specified period, usually a month or a year. The percentage tells you how quickly prices rose during the period. For example, if the inflation rate for a gallon of gas is 2% per year, then gas prices will be 2% higher next year.</li>
      <li>The inflation rate is a critical component of the misery index, which is an economic indicator that helps to determine an average citizen's financial health.</li>
      <li>The most common is demand-pull inflation. That's when demand outpaces supply for goods or services. Buyers want the product so much that they're willing to pay higher prices. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>HOWEVER, like all great projects, we had our stumbling blocks before we found our <i>Golden</i> idea.

      <h2>Idea 1: Glamorous</h2>
      <p> Our first idea was one of glamorous proportions. We initially wanted to develop a Machine Learning algorythm to accurately predict future winners of Ru Paul's Drag Race
        through the first few episode's Runway Challenge winners, overall winners, and overall losers. Unfortunately, there isn't enough consistent data between seasons to accurately 
        analyze and create a clean data set. Unfortunately, we had to <i>sashay away</i> from that idea. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h2>Idea 2: Who is That?</h2>
      <p>Stumbling upon an image library with thousands of screenshots of each Simpsons character, we set out with the idea
        to use Machine Learning to create an algorythm which would accurately identify a character by a single image. Unfortunately, our AWS bucket did not have the appropriate power to handle the images, and our Machine Learning dreams were a bit lofty. We moved on
        to our final, more <i>sparkly</i> idea.</p>
